## Hashing Algorithm
![](https://img.shields.io/badge/Date--blue)

A hashing algorithm is a one-way mathematical function that takes arbitary length input and provides 
fixed-length output known as hash value. 

A cryptographic hash function (CHF) is a hash algorithm (a map of an arbitrary binary string to a binary string with a fixed size of n bits) that has special properties desirable for a cryptographic application. The most widely used family of hashing algorithms are Message Digest (MD) and Secure Hash Algorithm (SHA).
