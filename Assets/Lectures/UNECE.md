### World Forum for Harmonization of Vehicle Regulation (WP.29)

WP.29 was established in June 1952 as the "Working Party of experts on technical requirement of vehicles", while its current name was adopted in 2000.
The primary responsibility is to manage the multilateral Agreements signed in 1958, 1997 and 1998 concerning the technical prescriptions for the 
construction, approval of wheeled vehicles as well as their Periodic Technical Inspection and, to operate within the framework of these three Agreements.

##### Automated/autonomous and connected vehicle regulations
- R155 — cyber security
- R156 — software updates
- R157 — automated lane keeping system

The cybersecurity and software update proposals adopted by WP.29 require automakers to implement measures to:
- Manage vehicle cybersecurity risks.
- Secure vehicles by design to mitigate risks along the supply chain.
- Detect and respond to security incidents across the vehicle fleet.
- Provide safe, secure software updates that do not compromise vehicle safety.
